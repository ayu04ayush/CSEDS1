    Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature, primarily caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to rising global temperatures and a range of effects, including melting glaciers, rising sea levels, more intense extreme weather events like droughts and floods, and disruption to ecosystems and wildlife. Addressing global warming involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions through actions like using renewable energy, promoting conservation, and planting trees. 
Causes:
Burning Fossil Fuels: The Industrial Revolution and subsequent increase in energy use for electricity, transportation, and industry have led to a massive release of carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil, and natural gas. 
Deforestation: Cutting down forests reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, further contributing to the buildup of greenhouse gases. 
Industrial and Agricultural Processes: Other human activities and agricultural practices release potent greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide. 
Effects:
Temperature Rise: The planet's average temperature has been steadily increasing, with the most recent years being the warmest on record. 
Rising Sea Levels: Melting glaciers and polar ice are causing sea levels to rise, threatening coastal communities. 
Extreme Weather: Global warming contributes to more frequent and intense weather events, such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall, droughts, and severe storms. 
Ecological Impacts: Disrupted habitats, loss of biodiversity, and extinction of plant and animal species are direct consequences of climate change. 
Solutions:
Renewable Energy: Shifting to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power can reduce reliance on fossil fuels. 
Conservation: Using less electricity and promoting public transport helps decrease energy consumption and pollution. 
Reforestation: Planting more trees and protecting existing forests are crucial for absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
Education and Awareness: Raising public awareness about climate change and its impacts encourages collective action and sustainable practices.
